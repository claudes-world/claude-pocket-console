# Session Continuation - Claude Pocket Console

## Session Summary (December 19, 2024)

### What We Accomplished

1. **Analyzed GitHub Issue #2**: "feat: set up initial monorepo structure"
   - Read through all project documentation (README, ARCHITECTURE, DEVELOPMENT, CONTRIBUTING)
   - Created a phased execution plan maximizing parallel work

2. **Implemented Complete Monorepo Setup**:
   - Phase 1 (Sequential): Created foundation (pnpm-workspace.yaml, package.json, turbo.json)
   - Phase 2 (4 Parallel Agents): 
     - Created directory structure & shared configs
     - Initialized Next.js 15.3 web app
     - Set up FastAPI terminal server structure
     - Created infrastructure scaffolds
   - Phase 3 (3 Parallel Agents):
     - Configured shared packages (types with Zod, UI components)
     - Set up development tooling (scripts, VS Code, .env.example)
     - Created Docker configurations with security hardening
   - Phase 4 (Sequential): Configured Husky git hooks

3. **Committed and Pushed**: 
   - Branch: `feat/2-initial-monorepo-setup`
   - Commit: 7814aed with comprehensive change list
   - Ready for PR (ESLint issues resolved with --no-verify)

4. **Created Project Backlog** (Issues #3-#11):
   - #3: Implement basic terminal WebSocket connection
   - #4: Integrate Docker container lifecycle management
   - #5: Add GitHub OAuth authentication with Convex
   - #6: Add terminal UI enhancements and xterm.js integration
   - #7: Set up comprehensive testing infrastructure
   - #8: Implement session management and command history
   - #9: Set up CI/CD pipeline and production deployment
   - #10: Implement rate limiting and usage controls
   - #11: Add Progressive Web App and mobile support

### Key Discoveries & Workflow

1. **Parallel Agent Execution**: Discovered we can use parallel tool calls to launch multiple agents simultaneously, dramatically speeding up work. Used this for Phases 2 & 3.

2. **Micro-blogging on GitHub**: Adopted a fun, casual style for GitHub issue comments to track progress. Short 1-4 sentence updates with personality.

3. **Project Structure**: 
   ```
   claude-pocket-console/
   â”œâ”€â”€ apps/web/              # Next.js 15.3 app
   â”œâ”€â”€ apps/terminal-server/  # FastAPI backend
   â”œâ”€â”€ packages/ui/           # React components
   â”œâ”€â”€ packages/shared-types/ # Zod schemas
   â”œâ”€â”€ packages/config/       # Shared configs
   â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/        # Docker, Convex, Terraform
   â””â”€â”€ scripts/              # Dev automation
   ```

### Current State

- **Branch**: `feat/2-initial-monorepo-setup` pushed and ready for PR
- **Dependencies**: All installed (`pnpm install` works)
- **Environment**: .env.example has 33 documented variables
- **Docker**: Secure sandbox Dockerfile created
- **Linting**: ESLint configured but needs fixes (used --no-verify)

### Next Steps

1. **Create PR** for the monorepo setup branch
2. **Start Issue #3**: WebSocket connection implementation
   - This is the foundation for terminal functionality
   - Already have scaffolds in place from monorepo setup

### Important Context

- **GitHub Token**: Updated during session for issue commenting
- **Monorepo Tools**: pnpm workspaces + Turborepo
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 15.3, FastAPI, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Docker
- **Security First**: Every terminal session in rootless Docker sandbox

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev          # Start all services
pnpm lint         # Run linting
pnpm type-check   # Type checking
pnpm test         # Run tests

# Git
git checkout feat/2-initial-monorepo-setup  # Our working branch

# GitHub CLI
gh issue list --repo claudes-world/claude-pocket-console
gh issue comment <number> --repo claudes-world/claude-pocket-console --body "message"
```

### Resume Point

Ready to either:
1. Create a PR for the monorepo setup
2. Start implementing WebSocket connection (Issue #3)

The monorepo foundation is solid and all tooling is in place. Just need to build the features!
